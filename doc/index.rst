Welcome to libaps's documentation!
==================================

The BBN Arbitrary Pulse Sequencer (APS) is an arbitrary waveform generator with an advanced sequencing ability. The sequencer allows for specification of individual operations (gates) to be defined as units in a waveform library, so that an algorithm/experiment can be defined by stringing together sequences of gates and delays. This results in a very compact description for efficient memory use.
