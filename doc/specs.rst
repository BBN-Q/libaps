Specifications
===============

Each unit has four 14-bit 1.2 GS/s analog output channels and four 300 MS/s digital marker channels. The clocks can be synchronized to an external 10 MHz reference. The device can be triggered internally or via an external trigger input. The device uses low-noise linear power supplies with an ultra-low-noise buffer amplifier on the DAC outputs to provide a system noise comparable to a 1 kOhm resistor.
