C/C++ Driver for the BBN APSv1

This repository provides the C++ (with a C calling API) driver for controlling the first generation BBN Arbitrary Pulse Sequencer (APS).  In addition to the C driver we provide thin Matlab and Python wrappers.  This generation of APS is obsolete but information about the much improved version 2 can be found [here](https://quantum.bbn.com/tools/aps).
